4. ID of user could be important. Some users may use Expedia exclusively for business or leisure travel.
5. is_package could be an indicator of a leisure/resort hotel.
6. Distance travelled is available 
7. This seems like this may work better as a classification problem instead of a regression problem
8. What does search_destination_type_ID 
9. How can datetime of activity be used? Length of time that trip is being booked in advance could be useful feature.
10. What about season? What is the season for the checkin date (Fall/Summer/Winter/Spring)? Are the trip dates during a holiday?
11. How to handle nulls in the destionation data? Fill in with mean?
